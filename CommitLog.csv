6f08b16,FirestarW,Rotating Pillars,Added rotating pillars using placeholder sprites.

Pillars will switch between any number of added sprites when the player is in range (uses same code as RotateObject)

Pillars also can be configured to only be useable by the Human, Ghost or Both.

Pillars are also added to objectives manager and when all pillars are in correct state they switch to placeholder pillar complete sprite

,Wed Mar 13 13:58
b8d7233,FirestarW,Light Puzzle,Added light puzzle into samplescene

Lights are currently in 3d enviroment due to problems with 2d raycast only going along +z axis

The 3d raycast doesnt always properly hit the target (causes flickering)
,Wed Mar 13 13:48
ae4c3b2,BadOrchid,Further Level Adjustment,More changes to come (compartmentalising the level changes from the mechanical changes to prevent unnecessary issues later)

Specific notes on the level:

Invisible walls added in foreground; courtyard still has leavable bounds.

All Interior rooms have proper wall collision, but no doors - require use of existing door prefab, these will be locked based on an area wide objective manager.

Doors need to be adjusted within layers.

Layering still an issue for players. Genuinely no clue how to do this. Truly eludes me.

Added Objectives game object to store levers and plates, with arrays that store what objectives are On/Off for the puzzle to complete
